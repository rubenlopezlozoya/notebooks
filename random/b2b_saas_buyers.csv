It was built by the people behind Startpage, the world’s first private search engine.\n\nAs early as 2005 we recognized the need to treat privacy as a fundamental right. We turned out to be ahead of our time. Over the next decade, revelation after revelation showed how much our online privacy had come under attack. In response, we built more and more defenses into our search engines to protect our users.\n\nPeople now use Startpage and Ixquick to find information millions of times per day, without being tracked or profiled.\n\nWe then turned to our next challenge: email privacy. Everyone uses email, but sending regular email is like sending a postcard—it makes snooping very easy!\n\nAdvanced encryption technology already exists to stop hacking and mass surveillance. Making this technology user‐friendly was our challenge.\n\nThat’s why we built StartMail from scratch: a total solution for protecting your email privacy that includes features like extra-secure data storage, disposable email addresses, and an ownership that will resist unwarranted intrusion. It has easy‐to‐use ‘one‐click’ encryption, and a very clear privacy policy.\nIn April 2016 we launched StartMail for Businesses (now called Custom Domain Accounts) - use your own domain name(s) for email addresses.\n",The Hague,Privately Held,12,11-50,,,,,,2012,"Easy to use private email service, empowering individuals and businesses to reclaim their online privacy.","Technology, Information and Internet",1095,StartMail,2025-01-10 17:15:26.420545 UTC,NL,The Netherlands,10640693,"[""The Hague Security Delta - HSD, Wilhelmina van Pruisenweg 104, The Hague, The Netherlands 2595 AN, NL""]","The Hague Security Delta - HSD, Wilhelmina van Pruisenweg 104, The Hague, The Netherlands 2595 AN, NL",,,,,,,,,,,,,[],,2025-01-13 05:07:17.747740 UTC,StartMail,12,,,2012,"Technology, Information and Internet",,https://linkedin.com/company/10640693,,1,Netherlands
