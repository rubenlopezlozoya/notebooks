I have a track record of building strong interpersonal relationships across cultures and functions, and of helping teams learn and analyze complex principles & data quickly, translating them into actionable business processes that create commercial value. 

I'm a family man, happily married to Jenn and a father of six. Professionally, I relish the challenge of finding synergies between partners and customers to meet the rapidly-evolving needs of consumers (B2C) and businesses (B2B) in the IoT era.

Over the last 20 years, I’ve met face-to-face with more than 90,000 people, engaging with them as a director, manager, or as an individually-contributing sales or marketing professional. I have learned about customers’ ambitions/goals, and then partnered with them to map out the steps needed to achieve their targets. Digitally, I have engaged in live and on-demand video presentations to interact with another 50,000 people. 

In leading large and small teams, I have successfully implemented new business models and high-quality sales pipeline management in both cutting edge and traditionally commoditized industries (digital pathology, computer software, oil & gas, higher education, real estate, sports coaching, door-to-door sales). I have achieved these sweeping changes through the use of proprietary technologies (AI/Machine Learning/cloud-based/SaaS/petrochemical formulations) and laser-focused attention on the short- and long-term needs of our customers & prospects throughout the sales cycle, never losing focus on how to keep them relevant, profitable, and sustainable.

David’s career launched at Utah’s largest management construction firm, Okland Construction, where he quickly made an impact by integrating systems that drove $2MM in additional revenue. Recognized for his leadership and operational acumen, he was recruited by one of Okland’s subcontractors as CFO. During his tenure, David steered the company through the 2008 construction crisis, securing private equity funding to stabilize operations and chart a course for long-term success.

David’s entrepreneurial journey began concurrently when he co-founded a SaaS startup, gaining invaluable experience that catapulted him into the tech industry. This led to his role as CFO at InXpress, where he spearheaded initiatives that increased EBITDA by 45% and contributed $12MM in additional revenue.

In 2015, David joined Lendio, a premier FinTech company, where he played a pivotal role in securing Series C funding, scaling operations, and driving exponential growth through both organic efforts and strategic acquisitions.

As CEO of Smilelove, David co-founded and built a DTC orthodontics company, achieving a $20MM run rate with minimal funding. He developed innovative systems for a complex medical product, automated workflows, and scaled the team from 0 to 50 employees, achieving unmatched efficiency in the industry.

Most recently, David served as CFO of Kadence, a multinational SaaS company specializing in workplace management solutions. There, he transformed global operations, secured $6MM in venture capital, and decreased the company’s burn rate by over 50% while doubling the team size and scaling its multi-channel business model.

David’s leadership style is grounded in empowerment, accountability, and a relentless focus on outcomes.

202,Potter,Jon,Jon Potter,"Lehi, Utah, United States","I am a Finance executive bringing years of in-the-trenches SaaS experience. I build rapport across the company, tell the story from the numbers, and offer inspiring leadership that empowers growth.

Finance Exec.
From fundraising to KPIs, I tell the story for the numbers. I remember my knees rattling as I presented for the first time to a board of directors, worried they would want every detail of our financial statements. I have since learned that the most important aspect in presenting financial reports and metrics is the story. CEOs, investors, and the management team want to know where we’ve been and where we will go. I break the numbers down, so that we can make decisions that dominate markets, raise capital, create great products, and make happy employees.

Inspiring Leader.
I have lead Junior Jazz teams to victory, rock bands to ruckus applause, and church teams to faithful service. In the office, I am happy to dig into the details or wrangle with the next high-level, strategic decision. The most important thing to me is that we all win as a team. I believe this approach to leadership is why a former CEO told me that people are willing to work better and harder for me. I inspire people to bring their best and elevate their performance out of the joy of team success.

Renaissance Man.
I have had a lot of brutal jobs - ditches in the desert, cell towers hundreds of feet high, support calls, mind-numbing hours as a CPA, and, hardest of all, little league baseball umpire. I have been told several times by my CEO that I am a Renaissance Man. My vast experiences in the Finance world (tax, audit, financial operations, systems, FP&A, etc.) enable me to bring great insights, and my broad work experiences, SaaS and otherwise, help me bring perspective and build rapport.

If I sound like the kind of Finance pro that you want to know better, please send me a message.

I was determined to invest in my personal growth and career. Despite all the challenges, roadblocks, and adversities, I keep going. I'm that person. Once I say I'll do something, it will happen. Since then, I have accomplished many things. I learned English and Spanish. I graduated from the University of Utah (Go Utes!), and I have a beautiful family. 

Now, I put that perseverance to work as an Account Executive with 10+ years of experience selling into Latin America (LATAM) & U.S. Territory in an Enterprise SaaS space. I combined my interpersonal skills and entrepreneurial mindset to help clients achieve their full potential and goals. 

I love being part of a high-performing team. If we work together, we will succeed and have fun along the way.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO) FOR MULTINATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & LOGISTICS FIRMS
With more than 17 years of entrepreneurial, financial, and cross-functional leadership experience for high prospect, global logistics and technology firms, I use a combination of in-depth institutional knowledge, cultural insights, and strategic, analytical-based decision-making to lead cross-border innovation and untangle financial and analytical complexity.

◾◾◾Protecting Business through High-Level Financial Analysis
⦁ Enabled informed, data-driven decision-making for Nature’s Sunshine Products (NSP) ’s Senior Leadership by building financial and evaluation models to consolidate, analyze, and transform divergent data sources into transparent reports.
⦁ Helped boost NSP’s stock price as a key player in efforts to secure the release from a poorly-written contract.
⦁ Used GAAP principles to lower payments and determined and valued NSP’s Best Alternative to the Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) to establish a better bargaining position.

◾◾◾Trusted, Cross-Functional Advisor & Team Builder
⦁ Worked with company department heads to achieve a 400% profit growth by helping them prioritize and focus on more profitable opportunities.
⦁ Steered Senior Leadership away from a high-cost, low potential return joint venture with a multibillion-dollar partner by using market analysis to drill down on the resulting narrow customer base that the company had had difficulties in profitably serving.
⦁ Established profitability in International Bridge’s Chinese-based operations in just 3.5 years, despite significant market competitiveness.

501,Phillips,Jess,Jess Phillips,"Farmington, Utah, United States","I have always had a passion for building businesses. 

I have been fortunate to co-found Auric Solar in 2010, which we bootstrapped from my incredible partner's garage, and see it grow to $250M+ in revenue and 250+ employees at its peak. What a ride! 

I co-founded Enium, a solar finance company, in 2013. I learned so many new things about the world of finance and watched it process hundreds of millions in loans across the U.S. and Puerto Rico before being bought out in 2019.

I owned a small construction company (Temporary Power Services) for eight years and have watched it grow from $350k in annual revenue when we purchased it to a 7-figure exit for two partners and me in 2023.

We launched a new concept in the solar industry (Quativa) in Jan 2021, an all-in-one technology platform and installation marketplace. 2 years later, we celebrated our 10,000 sale and nearly $500M in solar jobs contracted through the platform!

GetFreedomFlowing.com originated from a critical moment when a client suggested, ""You should do this professionally."" Since then, I’ve offered consulting and coaching, helping a select group of individuals and businesses succeed. As opportunities have arisen, I've become known for guiding others in creating a life where their personal and professional development go hand in hand.

I currently work at Aveyo, helping sales dealers find a home they can rely on to fulfill their solar projects across the U.S. I chose to work at Aveyo because of the incredible leadership, values, and momentum they have created in such a short period!

I founded Freedom Fund, which provides 25.44% returns for our investors who invest in real estate renovation projects. 

Front yard candy store, paper route, Lagoon amusement park, LDS mission, summer sales door to door, working for a major corporation in sales, and being mentored by a billionaire customer/partner are some of the most impactful jobs/roles I have had that have taught me many important lessons that have shaped me.

I have an incredibly supportive girlfriend who knows what I need (advice, validation, wake-up call, etc). I have a stepson whom I have raised since he was 5, who is 22, and 2 girls who are 16 and 12.

Some of my favorite things:
- Basketball
- Cars
- Catch Me if You Can, Gladiator, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Office
- Seeing teammates and friends have success in their careers

Between playing lacrosse for BYU and a demanding course schedule, it was impossible to find a job that would give real world experience and offered enough for my needs. 

I worked part time on the weekends, full-time during the summer and still needed to to take out thousands of dollars of student loans. Even though I  was doing everything I  could and everything that I  was being told to do, I felt stuck. Sacrificing all my free time and still digging myself a financial pit in the future didn't feel like the solution.

I  stumbled upon an internship opportunity that advertised that their average intern making double what I     was making in a year. I jumped at the thought of buying myself back a year of time. That initiative paid off in a big way.

During that 2019 summer I  finished as the top first year intern. Not only was I offered a management position the next year but went back to school with $120k in the bank account. Over the next 3 years I've been the #1 rep in the company two years in a row, earned two ""Golden Door"" awards, and managed several of the top performing intern teams.

637,Florence,Colt,Colt Florence,"Ogden, Utah, United States","Marine Biologist... That is what I wanted to be growing up. A MARINE BIOLOGIST!

I graduated high school and began my college education studying everything necessary to go into the biology field. Not realizing at any point that I am a pretty weak swimmer and on top of that, terrified of most sea life.

THANK THE LORD I DECIDED TO SERVE A LDS MISSION. 

How did serving a mission benefit me? 
1) I got to live in the beautiful country of Chile for 2 years and can now fluently speak Spanish
2) I was taught about humility and how to put others needs first
3) I realized that I am damn good at sales (serving a mission is literally door to door sales)

Needless to say upon returning from my mission, everything changed. 

I changed my degree to Applied Sciences and Technology with an emphasis in Professional Sales. I began reading every sales and business book that I could get my hands on. I participated in some awesome extracurricular activities. I competed and won some some national and state sales and marketing competitions. Met my awesome wife that pushes me to be better every single day and found some amazing mentors and met some of my best friends to this day. 

Most importantly, I found my love and passion within the business world (well, maybe a close second to my wife).

I am a car junkie.
...but since there is not a lot of money in being a ""junkie""​, I had to find a more responsible way to support my family...and the car habit.

BUSINESS:
I have a 29 year background in Sales, Tele-Sales and Sales Management. My background ranges from Real Estate and Land Development, Financial Consultation (in Investment Alternatives and Private Placements) to Tech Services.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
I am an active Real Estate Investor and always looking to expand my horizons.  I try to keep my eyes wide open because the world around us changes very fast.  Who would have thought, 29 years ago when I started my sales career, that eventually I'd be involved in providing IPTV to ISPs (or even know what those acronyms mean)?!  For many, the career you pursue for years may vanish, for others, we'll be working in fields that don't currently exist!

It costs zero to discover if you can keep more of the money you are spending on shipping. All you need is a recent bill or data from your current shipping platform. With that, eHub can give you a free assessment and recommend the most ideal carrier, packaging and service level to save you money.

Many other clients have done the same thing including: 
 ● Amerimark
 ● Toyota
 ● Vox Fulfillment
 ● OTCWholesale
 ● Vuori Clothing
 ● Rocky Mountain ATV
and many more

If this sounds interesting to you reach out to me via email at: chandlerburgon@ehub.com or call me on my mobile at: 970-270-9767. I won't waste your time and the experience will save you money regardless of whether or not we decide to do business together.


eHub is a shipping API that connects webstores, shopping carts, software and shipping platforms to simplify order aggregation and label printing. This same API also allows clients to take advantage of competitive rates from all carriers.

My expertise lies in targeting high-value prospects, managing sales funnels, developing effective lead generation strategies, and inspiring sales development teams while encouraging a culture of high performance, optimism, perseverance, and accountability.

As a child, I was raised in a military family and was taught the value of self-discipline and organization at an early age.  While in high school and college, I humbly began my career running a mailroom for a prominent software firm in Salt Lake City. Here I developed strong habits that would later become instrumental in my professional success.

As my career progressed, I was afforded an opportunity as a systems analyst for a medical coding software company. Through hard work and a keen analytical mind, I quickly rose through the ranks.

In 2012, I joined the Fusion-io team as a Sales Development Representative where I consistently exceeded performance metrics which was highlighted by eight consecutive months of quota attainment and the highest close percentage for opportunities generated.

In 2013, I was hired by NICE Systems (formerly inContact Inc.) as a Sales Development Representative where I continued to flourish. By the time I was offered a Sales Development Manager position in 2014, I was well-equipped to lead, driving the success of my team. Together, we achieved a 30% pipeline growth year-over-year from 2014 to 2022. Focused on mentoring and coaching, I was recognized as the Top Business Development Manager company-wide for two consecutive years.

In 2022, I was offered a position at Centrical as the Director of Americas Business Development where I continued to have a significant impact. In 2022, my team and I generated 150 new business opportunities, achieving a $20 million pipeline at 114% of our goal. Together we achieved an impressive 50% of our annual goal in Q1 of 2023, reaching $12 million out of a $24 million target while remaining on track to reach $29 million by the end of 2023 and by the end of Q3 in 2023, we generated 210 opportunities with a $24 million pipeline at 126% of our goal.

839,Snarr,Chase E.,Chase E. Snarr,"South Jordan, Utah, United States","I am a compliance and risk professional, and I am a data scientist. I have more than ten years of compliance experience in the financial industry and seven more in compliance related roles in defense contracting, tax compliance, and construction projects. I also have five years of experience in enterprise risk management within the finance industry. I also have about five years of model risk management experience. I utilize data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis skills to manage the risk presented from the use of computer models in the Bank environment. I have achieved great successes. I have developed a fintech compliance program, a complaint management program, an enterprise risk management program, and a model risk management program. These were difficult achievements. The result is expertise in strategic partnerships / fintech compliance and risk, in complaint management, in risk management, and in model risk management. This expertise represents my efforts to write hundreds of policies and procedures, run committee meetings, develop training, present information, host conversations with board members and executive managers, brainstorming solutions, problem solving, and of course learning from mistakes along the way.

In my career I have developed an expertise in regulatory compliance with laws like ECOA, TILA, GLBA, FCRA, MLA, SCRA, and every day I learn more. I have experience interacting with state and federal regulators. I have experience with regulatory examinations, regulatory visitations, third party audit, and testing/monitoring programs. I have a technical expertise, technical certifications, and experience with varied programming languages including SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Python, and R.

What does my future hold? I am not just listing wishes. I have a path to follow, and I am working toward a destination. I want to be a VP of Risk before 2028. I want to be an SVP of risk before 2030. And I want to become a Chief Risk Officer by 2034. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science are going to be a big part of risk and compliance going forward. I am getting ahead of the curve with both an education and real experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and model risk management. Further, I continue to expand my expertise in compliance, and I am earning a CRCM certification.

That’s where we (eHub) come in.

Essential Hub is a shipping API that connects webstores, shopping carts, software and shipping platforms to simplify order aggregation and label printing. This same API also allows clients to take advantage of competitive rates from all carriers.

EssentialHub has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for many clients and the approach we use didn't require them to change what they were already doing.

At Workvivo, our core belief is that a positive employee experience is founded on a strong emotional connection to the company, its culture and values.  

According to Gallup, 3/4 of employees say they are missing out on important information from their leadership teams to successfully execute the strategy they’ve been given. This “change without understanding” can quickly lead to employees becoming disengaged; less enthusiastic and committed to their work.  And too many senior leaders get caught out by finding out too late what’s holding back their team - they simply don’t have the insight needed to get ahead. 

I'm an employee experience expert currently working alongside executives, Internal Comms, and HR leaders to streamline all internal comms, to build deeper connections with less noise, to capture the heartbeat of the organization, and to truly elevate the employee experience.

Key skills: Organizational & Team Leadership, Financial Reporting, Tax Strategy, Bank & Investor Relations, Business Development, Control Systems & Risk Mitigation, Strategic Planning, Treasury Management, Financial Planning & Analysis. 

Throughout my career, I have maintained a consistent record of providing sound and innovative leadership in not only financial disciplines, but also within operations, enterprise growth, and related areas. In particular, I have an extensive background in leading 180-degree turnarounds for under-performing entities and resolving key problems through alternative strategies. 

My experience includes senior financial management in both U.S. and Kenya operations, the latter providing numerous opportunities to create strategies for interacting with foreign government/business organizations and leaders. An example would be working through complex taxation issues with government entities, including mineral taxes, royalties, import, and VAT taxes. 

I have built a reputation not only as a savvy problem solver for existing issues, but also as a strategic analyst, forecaster, and planner who can establish strategies that prevented problems from occurring in the first place (see Term B loan item below). I am a goal-focused leader who inspires team members to reach/exceed goals and builds solid relationships within and external to the company. 

I cannot emphasize the latter point enough; of all my skills and ability, there is perhaps none as important as my ability to achieve buy-in and consensus from stakeholders and relevant parties.

I have a track record of building strong interpersonal relationships across cultures and functions, and of helping teams learn and analyze complex principles & data quickly, translating them into actionable business processes that create commercial value. 

I'm a family man, happily married to Jenn and a father of six. Professionally, I relish the challenge of finding synergies between partners and customers to meet the rapidly-evolving needs of consumers (B2C) and businesses (B2B) in the IoT era.

Over the last 20 years, I’ve met face-to-face with more than 90,000 people, engaging with them as a director, manager, or as an individually-contributing sales or marketing professional. I have learned about customers’ ambitions/goals, and then partnered with them to map out the steps needed to achieve their targets. Digitally, I have engaged in live and on-demand video presentations to interact with another 50,000 people. 

In leading large and small teams, I have successfully implemented new business models and high-quality sales pipeline management in both cutting edge and traditionally commoditized industries (digital pathology, computer software, oil & gas, higher education, real estate, sports coaching, door-to-door sales). I have achieved these sweeping changes through the use of proprietary technologies (AI/Machine Learning/cloud-based/SaaS/petrochemical formulations) and laser-focused attention on the short- and long-term needs of our customers & prospects throughout the sales cycle, never losing focus on how to keep them relevant, profitable, and sustainable.

Tell us your challenges (or your customers’ challenges) as you navigate today’s on-demand/real-time stakeholder expectations, and my team and I will help you find the resources to ""nail the pain"" you're facing on your journey to meet customers and partners “where they are now” and “where they hope to be tomorrow”.",Techcyte,urn:li:fs_salesCompany:7961728,Vice President of Sales,https://linkedin.com/company/7961728,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAfwa9wBKC2VzAXbeFga5mVwa2iM4gNS8Cs,NAME_SEARCH,KheD)",ACwAAAfwa9wBKC2VzAXbeFga5mVwa2iM4gNS8Cs,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAfwa9wBKC2VzAXbeFga5mVwa2iM4gNS8Cs,urn:li:member:133196764,techcyte.com

Executive leadership driving sales and marketing strategy that creates unique, profitable product positioning. 

“Always Be Growing”

As a trusted C-suite advisor in marketing and sales strategy for growth-focused companies, I both set the agenda and roll up my sleeves, working to increase my own skillset and the capability of my business. I have proved this in multiple global spaces, earning the trust of my teams and the accolades of my companies.

With a growth mindset, I have built a comprehensive toolkit of assets, capabilities, and talents that my current company, Maggie Sottero Designs, needed to excel. With smart marketing and sales programming, I led up to double-digit growth year over year across global regions. These strategic decisions were supported with knowledge of best practices honed over time plus a willingness to take thoughtful risks that yielded significant rewards for the company.

With strong emotional intelligence yet an eye for the bottom line, I train my teams to recognize untapped opportunities, engage with customers effectively, and continue to increase the value of their sales and marketing tactics. As a coach and mentor, I’m continually available to them, helping them also to “always be growing” in their capabilities and positions.

With over 20 years of experience spanning construction, technology, SaaS, and consumer goods, David has a proven track record of leading teams, inspiring innovation, and delivering exceptional results in fast-paced, high-stakes environments—all while being a dedicated father, avid skier, and lover of the outdoors.

David’s career launched at Utah’s largest management construction firm, Okland Construction, where he quickly made an impact by integrating systems that drove $2MM in additional revenue. Recognized for his leadership and operational acumen, he was recruited by one of Okland’s subcontractors as CFO. During his tenure, David steered the company through the 2008 construction crisis, securing private equity funding to stabilize operations and chart a course for long-term success.

David’s entrepreneurial journey began concurrently when he co-founded a SaaS startup, gaining invaluable experience that catapulted him into the tech industry. This led to his role as CFO at InXpress, where he spearheaded initiatives that increased EBITDA by 45% and contributed $12MM in additional revenue.

In 2015, David joined Lendio, a premier FinTech company, where he played a pivotal role in securing Series C funding, scaling operations, and driving exponential growth through both organic efforts and strategic acquisitions.

As CEO of Smilelove, David co-founded and built a DTC orthodontics company, achieving a $20MM run rate with minimal funding. He developed innovative systems for a complex medical product, automated workflows, and scaled the team from 0 to 50 employees, achieving unmatched efficiency in the industry.

Most recently, David served as CFO of Kadence, a multinational SaaS company specializing in workplace management solutions. There, he transformed global operations, secured $6MM in venture capital, and decreased the company’s burn rate by over 50% while doubling the team size and scaling its multi-channel business model.

David’s leadership style is grounded in empowerment, accountability, and a relentless focus on outcomes.

I also work as a fractional CFO for multiple fast-growing businesses.

Before joining Amplēo in 2021, I worked for over 10 years in various accounting and finance leadership positions. Early in my career, I led the finance and accounting at multiple SaaS and PE-backed companies which experienced successful exits. During my corporate career, I worked with companies in banking, restaurant, healthcare, and e-commerce.  I’ve also had experience raising debt & equity capital, implementing new technology, hiring & training top-tier professionals, building scalable processes, and executing financial strategies.

WHY AMPLĒO

Amplēo has helped 3,000+ companies–ranging from traditional businesses of all sizes, to funded startups–succeed over the last 25 years by pairing them with the experienced fractional executives they need to address roadblocks to growth.

If you’re looking for senior finance, marketing, or HR leadership but you don’t have a full-time workload or budget, or you need an interim solution due to recent changes, we can help. Our executives have held senior-level positions and consulted across companies of all sizes. Leveraging their experience, they help you avoid common pitfalls while creating maximum impact.

With our deep pool of talent, having 120+ executives in our network, and our ever growing knowledge base, we’re able to pair you with the ideal executive who can start providing value immediately (versus the 3+ months needed for an internal executive hire).

What does that look like in today’s scaling business world?
 
It’s like Jeb Blount cake with Gary Vee frosting, a sprinkle of Marie Forelo with Brendan Burchard candle and voila, you have Michelle Terpstra’s startup growth methodology.

Here’s the thing…most companies treat marketing and sales as very different departments; now, while they each have different responsibilities, too much isolation causes communication disconnects and complicates scaling. Michelle takes a holistic and unconventional approach by marrying the two departments to build a revenue machine. 

Her unique background in organizational communications, sales, digital marketing and leadership development helps her make the biggest impact as Chief Revenue Officer. 

She has worked for Fortune 500s, scaled her own sales training company to serve over 1,000 customers, and served as a fractional leader for many of the most beloved professional coaching companies across the world. 

She recently helped her client, 7-Figure MSP, a professional coaching company serving IT & MSP business owners, hit #1686 on the Inc 5000 in 2024 as the Chief Revenue Officer.

1031,"Dickson, CFP® CRPC®",Easton,"Easton Dickson, CFP® CRPC®","South Jordan, Utah, United States","Bottom-line… I love seeing the look on someone’s face when they experience real unexpected unadulterated value. That is the impact I want to make. That is what drives me in life.

You can call me a ""people-pleaser"" if you want, but ever since grade school, I knew that genuine relationships with others had to be a part of my life forever. That natural affinity for people and my low-key prowess for congeniality quickly grooved its way into my personality as I entered the family-owned bakery business at 13 years old.

The family business instilled a work ethic that I will forever be grateful for. I’m not afraid of hard work and love to dig deeper when most people want to give up.  

That work ethic carried me to graduating high school with an honor’s diploma, a two-year church mission to Chile, and to the University of Utah where I paid and paved my own way, graduating with a degree in Financial Planning & Counseling.

The world of personal finance has always captured my attention as a career path that I knew I could be successful with. It checked all my boxes. 

As I started school, I accepted a position at Fidelity Investments, where I began studying for my series 7 and 63 licenses. After passing, I quickly established myself as a top-performing representative for the company even while going to school on the side.

As I set out on an expedition to ultimately find a wealth management company that I could lay down some long-term roots with, Divergent Wealth was heads and shoulders above the rest. Their vision, their process, and their client experience were inspiring, but the deal maker was the humble culture and life focus in and out of the office.

When I am not relentlessly focused on serving our clients, you'll probably find me spending my time with my wife and daughter, or hopelessly attempting to lower my handicap on the golf course.",NFP Retirement Division,urn:li:fs_salesCompany:66783,Associate Vice President - Wealth Management,https://linkedin.com/company/66783,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAC9PsPwBHsbr_c1cqngJqbNaj9NS2kbodTM,NAME_SEARCH,Drpd)",ACwAAC9PsPwBHsbr_c1cqngJqbNaj9NS2kbodTM,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAAC9PsPwBHsbr_c1cqngJqbNaj9NS2kbodTM,urn:li:member:793751804,nfp.com

1049,Potter,Jon,Jon Potter,"Lehi, Utah, United States","I am a Finance executive bringing years of in-the-trenches SaaS experience. I build rapport across the company, tell the story from the numbers, and offer inspiring leadership that empowers growth.

Finance Exec.
From fundraising to KPIs, I tell the story for the numbers. I remember my knees rattling as I presented for the first time to a board of directors, worried they would want every detail of our financial statements. I have since learned that the most important aspect in presenting financial reports and metrics is the story. CEOs, investors, and the management team want to know where we’ve been and where we will go. I break the numbers down, so that we can make decisions that dominate markets, raise capital, create great products, and make happy employees.

Inspiring Leader.
I have lead Junior Jazz teams to victory, rock bands to ruckus applause, and church teams to faithful service. In the office, I am happy to dig into the details or wrangle with the next high-level, strategic decision. The most important thing to me is that we all win as a team. I believe this approach to leadership is why a former CEO told me that people are willing to work better and harder for me. I inspire people to bring their best and elevate their performance out of the joy of team success.

Renaissance Man.
I have had a lot of brutal jobs - ditches in the desert, cell towers hundreds of feet high, support calls, mind-numbing hours as a CPA, and, hardest of all, little league baseball umpire. I have been told several times by my CEO that I am a Renaissance Man. My vast experiences in the Finance world (tax, audit, financial operations, systems, FP&A, etc.) enable me to bring great insights, and my broad work experiences, SaaS and otherwise, help me bring perspective and build rapport.

If I sound like the kind of Finance pro that you want to know better, please send me a message.

I have a natural curiosity and I am constantly wanting and willing to learn more. I attribute this to how I “moved up the ranks” in my company from a Finance Coordinator to Controller. I readily rolled up my sleeves and dove into learning all aspects of my industry and learned the importance of being flexible to change. This path was also beneficial in understanding outlying information such as IRS 1099 reporting, escheatment compliance, Department of Insurance, HIPAA, and payroll processes.

I love a project that has a finite answer; much like a puzzle. These types of challenges excite me because I like to see the big picture, understand the “why”, and then dive into finding a solution. I am known for excelling in these tasks both independently and within a team. Coming to a successful resolution brings me great satisfaction as I am able to continuously gain experience and knowledge.

Many entrepreneurs feel underserved by traditional financial advisors, often finding that advice doesn't align with their business needs or that their plans lack relevance to their unique journey. Too often, they’re given solutions that don't match their vision or told to come back until they’ve ""built a larger portfolio.""

Typical financial advisors are well equipped to serve traditional employees, but they often fall short of the complexity and needs of a business owner's financial plan. My team and I take a different approach. We prioritize your business as the cornerstone of your financial plan. We help entrepreneurs maximize their wealth by creating tailored strategies around their largest and most valuable asset—their business.

Here’s what sets us apart and what clients value most:
➣ We understand the pivotal role your business plays in your financial future and help unlock its full wealth-building potential.
➣ We provide an estimated valuation of your business, both current and future.
➣ Our comprehensive financial plans cover cash flow management, tax strategy, investment planning, risk management, estate planning, retirement, and business strategy.
➣ We give you a clear roadmap, aligning your resources with your goals to ensure clarity and progress.  
➣ We bridge gaps in your personal finances, helping you avoid future challenges and ensuring smooth transitions as you build wealth.
➣ Acting as your personal CFO, we work closely with you to save time and keep you on track toward your goals.
➣ As a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and fiduciary, we offer unbiased, reliable advice that always serves your best interests.
➣ We collaborate with your CPA, attorneys, and other professionals to ensure seamless decision-making.
➣You’ll also gain access to my network of trusted advisors, from accountants to business coaches.

If you’ve been struggling to find the right financial guidance or this approach resonates with you, let's connect. I offer a process that allows you to understand the value we bring before making any commitments.

1268,Yuen-Goh,Jo-Ann,Jo-Ann Yuen-Goh,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States","Jo-Ann has a background in multiple aspects of finance across industries like mining, manufacturing, healthcare, fintech & telecoms. She was based in London, Vancouver, Singapore, Perth, Los Angeles & Salt Lake City, & hopes to continue the geographic experience. In May 2022 she left Sorenson after a successful change in PE ownership.

Whether a company is years young or centuries old, Jo-Ann as CFO has been versatile in dealing with strategic issues while balancing the hands-on tasks. Being on the buy-side or sell-side transaction sounds sexy but takes grit & spending long nights with tedious bankers & lawyers. Much better to be working with Sales on pricing decisions & the right incentives, or with Operations in driving higher productivity. All while keeping the lenders happy with cash, the Board well informed & the exec team with data & insights so we can all make better decisions.

As VP Finance at Nav and Nelson Labs, Jo-Ann did everything you would ordinarily expect of that position - disrupting the reporting lethargy, shaking up the budgeting process, making non-finance people love finance, building brilliant teams & throwing in a few acquisitions to keep life busy.

As CFO Rio Tinto Technology & Innovation, Jo-Ann was accountable for planning, risk, compliance, valuations and business improvement. As CFO Copper Projects she oversaw billions of dollars in capital spending over greenfield projects. Jo-Ann served on the Board of Palabora (listed copper producer), and board sub-committees of Escondida & Grasberg joint ventures, some of the largest copper producers in the world.

Jo-Ann would like to improve her skills as a skier, runner & swimmer where she is driven by a passion for fitness rather than natural talent. She has already given up on mountain biking as she holds up lines of angry bikers who tell her to stick to spin class. In the pool, Ironman keeps lapping her and Jo-Ann thinks he should switch to a bigger pool or ocean with lots of sharks.

Testimonial extract:
As a leader Jo-Ann is scrupulously fair & consistent. In my experience, genuinely high-performing teams are rare, despite the extensive literature. Jo-Ann creates & sustains them. I have listened to her team members describe not only the support & guidance they need & enjoy, but also the importance of the honest feedback & constructive criticism. I find her insights sharp & she has an uncanny ability to detect mistakes across the full taxonomy of errors. Jo-Ann is always interested in introducing new approaches, ideas & methods.

With more than 17 years of entrepreneurial, financial, and cross-functional leadership experience for high prospect, global logistics and technology firms, I use a combination of in-depth institutional knowledge, cultural insights, and strategic, analytical-based decision-making to lead cross-border innovation and untangle financial and analytical complexity.

◾◾◾Protecting Business through High-Level Financial Analysis
⦁ Enabled informed, data-driven decision-making for Nature’s Sunshine Products (NSP) ’s Senior Leadership by building financial and evaluation models to consolidate, analyze, and transform divergent data sources into transparent reports.
⦁ Helped boost NSP’s stock price as a key player in efforts to secure the release from a poorly-written contract.
⦁ Used GAAP principles to lower payments and determined and valued NSP’s Best Alternative to the Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) to establish a better bargaining position.

◾◾◾Trusted, Cross-Functional Advisor & Team Builder
⦁ Worked with company department heads to achieve a 400% profit growth by helping them prioritize and focus on more profitable opportunities.
⦁ Steered Senior Leadership away from a high-cost, low potential return joint venture with a multibillion-dollar partner by using market analysis to drill down on the resulting narrow customer base that the company had had difficulties in profitably serving.
⦁ Established profitability in International Bridge’s Chinese-based operations in just 3.5 years, despite significant market competitiveness.

1399,"Scherz, Ed. M.",Benjamin,"Benjamin Scherz, Ed. M.","Salt Lake City, Utah, United States","As a Literacy Consultant with an almost 20-year track record of championing measurable results in literacy benchmark improvements within schools nationwide, I’m honored to unveil my new company and lifelong passion: Dreamland Reading. I launched this business because I’m an avid student advocate who recognizes that a one-size-fits-all approach to reading instruction can leave some children feeling overwhelmed and demoralized, and without understanding the obstacles and barriers students face, educators can experience hopelessness and frustration. I aim to empower teachers and students with targeted strategies that produce lasting outcomes.

WHAT WE CAN DO FOR YOU
At Dreamland Reading, we believe that reading is a gateway skill that starts students on the path of lifelong learning. This starts with meeting the needs of teachers, schools, and principals through professional development and coaching. We offer:

> WORKSHOPS: we supply training in the areas of targeted instruction, multitiered system of support, the science of reading instruction, teacher mentor training, leading for literacy, and more!

> IN-SCHOOL SUPPORT: this includes modeling lessons, support for reading coaches, data analysis, and principal training.

> DATA ANALYSIS: we complete data meetings and visualization to clarify strengths and communicate needs.

HOW WE ACHIEVE LITERACY GOALS
Hermeneutics provides a framework that allows continuous and transformative growth in adult learning, and this philosophy serves as the foundation for strategy creation and skills development.

Our process is simple but thorough: we assess needs, draft a plan, implement the plan while providing support, analyze data, and reflect and refine the results.

OUR APPROACH TO SUCCESS
Alexander Den Heijer said, “when a flower doesn’t bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.” At Dreamland Reading, we fix problems, not people, because people don’t need to be fixed. Problems need resolution and people need support, and we strive to dissolve problems and strengthen people, not the other way around.

READY TO GET STARTED?
I’d love to partner with you. Let’s move forward, together.

Using my creativity, problem-solving skills, listening to customer needs, and having empathy for the challenges they face brings great satisfaction as we progress their projects together. From small startups to large corporations, I've enjoyed interacting with customers from a very large variety of markets on many levels within their organizations.

Channeling customer efforts to determine what their market needs and demands is a focus of my communications with prospective clients. Developing project schedules, milestones, timelines, and tasking considering risks, challenges, and opportunities are also strengths of mine.

Carefully considering the entire path from new technology concept to final deliverable is vital to a new technology or product's success.  Having a great product that meets the needs of your target audience is only part of a successful product launch.  A well-developed marketing plan and a marketing budget, a strong business plan, and a great sales team or sales channel are also major elements that must be thoughtfully prepared.  

Working with clients to create new products and technologies that make a difference in many people's lives brings me great satisfaction.

1672,Mayfield,Nathan,Nathan Mayfield,"Provo, Utah, United States","I believe in elevating the companies and people I work for—in helping them achieve their goals and get to the next level.

I am a VP-level marketing and operations leader with over 19+ years of team management. I’m a strategist and innovator. My experience ranges from leading large scale projects and teams at a large billion dollar corporation to running the ins-and-outs of a small business of 70+ employees. Because of these past successes, I have developed the skills to get nearly any job done. 

My passion is exceptional storytelling and brand building through impeccable design and copywriting. Over my career, I have produced training systems, reduced hostilities & removed dysfunctional culture among teams, lead support teams to the highest customer service standard in our industry, art directed large scale model & product photo shoots, presented at national trade shows, and much more. 

I believe in service leadership, not just team management. I roll up my sleeves and go to work no matter the task. My teams work with me, not for me. I help build successful teams by adhering to the following principles in my management:

LEARN
Learning is about finding the pain points of both the business itself and the end user client. I am a purposeful learner. I ask the right questions and collect the research, trends and data to help your business make informed decisions. I believe in consistently looking for opportunities to enhance the businesses, products and teams I work with.

SERVE
Serving well is all about how you treat others—not about whether the result is good or bad for you personally. As I discover the pains a company has, I diligently work and apply my extensive skills to find solutions to help them meet their goals. I care enough to get creative when traditional solutions fail. It’s deciding that what matters to a customer (whether internal or external) matters to you too. 

At times it isn’t easy, you’ve got to balance the customer’s desires versus the goals of the company. In the end, I have found it is serving the needs of others without expecting something in return. Exceptional service, consistently delivered, builds trust. It builds relationships.

GROW
I lead teams to learn and serve and am devoted to helping others reach their goals. As I do this, growth naturally occurs both monetarily and in skill set. I find fulfillment in helping others reach their goals and enjoy the personal growth that occurs as a natural result. I provide solutions with boldness. I follow through with customers (internal & external) and make sure to act on feedback.",Fast Company Executive Board,urn:li:fs_salesCompany:67185250,Official Member,https://linkedin.com/company/67185250,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAC-30IBE4bLUD8BVCFS282kKZa3PsH90mA,NAME_SEARCH,hsdY)",ACwAAAC-30IBE4bLUD8BVCFS282kKZa3PsH90mA,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAC-30IBE4bLUD8BVCFS282kKZa3PsH90mA,urn:li:member:12508994,fastcompany.com

1720,Colbert,David,David Colbert,"Salt Lake City, Utah, United States","As an operationally-focused, data-driven CFO of global, private equity and public companies, I have effectively navigated complex situations, sorted through the noise to get at the facts, and responded quickly to launch strategic initiatives. I am a nimble and team-oriented executive with experiences at companies ranging from Fortune 500 to start-up in various industries: software, manufacturing, consumer goods and medical devices & supplies.

Additionally, I bring …

- business partner thinking with operational and finance acumen;
- the ability to build high-performance finance organizations and develop top talent;
- communication skills that transcend all levels of employees, executives, board members, and stakeholders.

After graduation, I joined Kimberly-Clark. My last position was a Divisional CFO role to lead a $250M medical device global enterprise. While successfully completing the first iteration of SOX404 (in 2001), directing M&A activities and divestiture valuations, I managed a $35M deal structured as an exclusive distributorship with an option-to-purchase Baylis Medical’s pain management division, which was ultimately acquired. 

After leaving KC, I co-founded Sendside Networks, creating the business plan, capital structure, and fundraising strategies. With two very effective Finance Chief roles at publicly-traded Park City Group and LifeVantage Corporation completed, Clayton Holdings brought me on board to guide finance and accounting for this wholly-owned subsidiary of Radian Group. Upon completing my work at Clayton, I’ve since joined Spectrum Solutions, a private equity backed manufacturing firm.

Over the last three years, I have …

- Expanded manufacturing capabilities and capacity (injection molding, formulation, compound Rx) through self-funded capex and reset strategic direction toward a high margin, end-to-end decentralized lab services business; and
- Acquired two companies critical to executing the strategic plan to expand the overall business up the value chain to higher margin products and services.","Vets Plus, Inc.",urn:li:fs_salesCompany:2208115,Chief Financial Officer,https://linkedin.com/company/2208115,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAACx4NAB_ghImdeVh7g-SQyRzIb_HXamMbs,NAME_SEARCH,1qOg)",ACwAAACx4NAB_ghImdeVh7g-SQyRzIb_HXamMbs,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAAACx4NAB_ghImdeVh7g-SQyRzIb_HXamMbs,urn:li:member:11657424,vetsplus.com

1812,Mumford,Ryan,Ryan Mumford,Salt Lake City Metropolitan Area,"Launching a startup company requires wearing a lot of hats.  While a senior executive with the company I built and managed the finance department, I also acted as HR, hired and fired employees, worked with investors, helped with sales and marketing, and did internal employee recognition.  I have over 10 years of experience in finance with skills in financial reporting, budgeting and forecasting, business analysis, SQL, Tableau, process improvement, project management, and ERP system implementation to name a few. Some of my biggest accomplishments have been building out my own finance department from the ground up, designing and implementing a revenue share model for independent distributors, and migrating operational data between back office software.

Currently, and for the last 6 years, I am serving as a City Councilmember for North Salt Lake City.  I am responsible for setting the annual budget of over $11M per year and setting policy for 65 employees. Through two election cycles I have worked one-on-one with residents to help improve my community. Public speaking, community outreach, dependability, working through difficult and emotional subjects, quickly moving on when the vote doesn't go your way, and working closely with people that you disagree with one moment and then solving a problem together in the next is all part of my service on the council.  

I’m a husband and father who loves hiking, biking, camping and being outdoors. I’m a tech enthusiast and constantly reading about the latest in the industry, I’ve even built my own computer. While I’m often deep into analyzing data, I’m an upbeat, energetic person who thrives on creativity and interaction with others.",ACTIVZ,urn:li:fs_salesCompany:18304906,Chief Financial Officer,https://linkedin.com/company/18304906,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAABiDdaABWg4cCx62o9MsIzebSTJG3sp4cJo,NAME_SEARCH,lyMA)",ACwAABiDdaABWg4cCx62o9MsIzebSTJG3sp4cJo,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAABiDdaABWg4cCx62o9MsIzebSTJG3sp4cJo,urn:li:member:411268512,activz.com

Whether it is clients who need a solid partner after working with under performing partners, processes that need improvements or can be replaced with better technology or the individual who needs the right encouragement, opportunities are everywhere.

I am careful in the commitments made and have established a strong track record of keeping commitments and exceeding expectations.  I love negotiations because finding the mutual win is almost always possible. I feel strongly about increasing shareholder value in the short and long-term.

I am dedicated to my family and regardless of the travel or work schedule, I stay close to them and involved in their lives.  Many of my hobbies and personal interests involve my wife and kids.",International Translating Company,urn:li:fs_salesCompany:2398060,"Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Americas",https://linkedin.com/company/2398060,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAAPRekBrIOhK9W--1UkI6j8IQzOCneFlsQ,NAME_SEARCH,yq5y)",ACwAAAAPRekBrIOhK9W--1UkI6j8IQzOCneFlsQ,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAAPRekBrIOhK9W--1UkI6j8IQzOCneFlsQ,urn:li:member:1000937,internationaltranslating.com

1872,Wright,Scott,Scott Wright,"Lehi, Utah, United States","Seasoned senior level financial executive with 5 years of Big Four public accounting work and 15+ years as a Chief Financial Officer of multiple small and mid-size organizations. More than a financial expert, but a value added key business partner, strategic adviser and transaction executor for the CEO/Business Owner. 

One of my biggest compliments is that I am much more than a typical finance guy, that I see the larger business strategy and add value in so many different arenas. I always have worn many different hats, running everything from strategy, to finance and accounting, to HR and legal, to IT and Software Development, to Supply chain and logistics, to media buying. I never look at my career as a series of jobs, but as several opportunities for me to employ my talents and energies in the best possible way to benefit an organization. I try to always live by the mantra that no task is too big nor too small to tackle.
