    "\n",
    "    1. **B2B Classification:**\n",
    "    - Confirm that the company's main products/services are aimed at other businesses rather than individual consumers.\n",
    "    - Exclude companies that provide services predominantly to consumers even if they have a business component (e.g., real estate services primarily for homeowners, automotive services for individual car owners).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **SaaS Classification:**\n",
    "    - A key aspect of identifying a company as a B2B SaaS is that it should not provide physical goods, financial services, consulting services, or custom software solutions.\n",
    "    - Identify if the company offers software that is accessed online through a subscription model without requiring users to manage infrastructure.\n",
    "    - Flag as not SaaS companies where the primary product is a hardware solution with software components (e.g., advanced imaging technology with browser-based interfaces, medical devices with analytics tools).\n",
    "    - Flag as not SaaS companies that do not provide software as a core part of their offering, even if they have software tools for internal use or to support their main services.\n",
    "    - Flag as not SaaS companies that provide tailored software solutions or consulting services as their primary offering, even if they have a SaaS product as an additional service.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Specific Exclusions:**\n",
    "    - Do not classify as B2B/SaaS if the company's core offering is professional services or consulting with ancillary software components (e.g., custom AI software development, enterprise-level solutions).\n",
    "    - Avoid classifying companies focused on providing educational content or training through online platforms as SaaS if the primary value is in the content rather than the software delivery model (e.g., online courses for hospitality professionals).\n",
    "    - Exclude companies where the SaaS component is a minor aspect of a broader service offering that includes significant non-software elements (e.g., automotive warranty services with a mobile app, psychological services for employee support).\n",
