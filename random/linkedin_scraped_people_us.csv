202,Potter,Jon,Jon Potter,"Lehi, Utah, United States","I am a Finance executive bringing years of in-the-trenches SaaS experience. I build rapport across the company, tell the story from the numbers, and offer inspiring leadership that empowers growth.

Finance Exec.
From fundraising to KPIs, I tell the story for the numbers. I remember my knees rattling as I presented for the first time to a board of directors, worried they would want every detail of our financial statements. I have since learned that the most important aspect in presenting financial reports and metrics is the story. CEOs, investors, and the management team want to know where we‚Äôve been and where we will go. I break the numbers down, so that we can make decisions that dominate markets, raise capital, create great products, and make happy employees.

Inspiring Leader.
I have lead Junior Jazz teams to victory, rock bands to ruckus applause, and church teams to faithful service. In the office, I am happy to dig into the details or wrangle with the next high-level, strategic decision. The most important thing to me is that we all win as a team. I believe this approach to leadership is why a former CEO told me that people are willing to work better and harder for me. I inspire people to bring their best and elevate their performance out of the joy of team success.

Renaissance Man.
I have had a lot of brutal jobs - ditches in the desert, cell towers hundreds of feet high, support calls, mind-numbing hours as a CPA, and, hardest of all, little league baseball umpire. I have been told several times by my CEO that I am a Renaissance Man. My vast experiences in the Finance world (tax, audit, financial operations, systems, FP&A, etc.) enable me to bring great insights, and my broad work experiences, SaaS and otherwise, help me bring perspective and build rapport.

If I sound like the kind of Finance pro that you want to know better, please send me a message.
