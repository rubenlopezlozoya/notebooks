I have a track record of building strong interpersonal relationships across cultures and functions, and of helping teams learn and analyze complex principles & data quickly, translating them into actionable business processes that create commercial value. 

I'm a family man, happily married to Jenn and a father of six. Professionally, I relish the challenge of finding synergies between partners and customers to meet the rapidly-evolving needs of consumers (B2C) and businesses (B2B) in the IoT era.

Over the last 20 years, I’ve met face-to-face with more than 90,000 people, engaging with them as a director, manager, or as an individually-contributing sales or marketing professional. I have learned about customers’ ambitions/goals, and then partnered with them to map out the steps needed to achieve their targets. Digitally, I have engaged in live and on-demand video presentations to interact with another 50,000 people. 

In leading large and small teams, I have successfully implemented new business models and high-quality sales pipeline management in both cutting edge and traditionally commoditized industries (digital pathology, computer software, oil & gas, higher education, real estate, sports coaching, door-to-door sales). I have achieved these sweeping changes through the use of proprietary technologies (AI/Machine Learning/cloud-based/SaaS/petrochemical formulations) and laser-focused attention on the short- and long-term needs of our customers & prospects throughout the sales cycle, never losing focus on how to keep them relevant, profitable, and sustainable.

73,202,Potter,Jon,Jon Potter,"Lehi, Utah, United States","I am a Finance executive bringing years of in-the-trenches SaaS experience. I build rapport across the company, tell the story from the numbers, and offer inspiring leadership that empowers growth.

Finance Exec.
From fundraising to KPIs, I tell the story for the numbers. I remember my knees rattling as I presented for the first time to a board of directors, worried they would want every detail of our financial statements. I have since learned that the most important aspect in presenting financial reports and metrics is the story. CEOs, investors, and the management team want to know where we’ve been and where we will go. I break the numbers down, so that we can make decisions that dominate markets, raise capital, create great products, and make happy employees.

Inspiring Leader.
I have lead Junior Jazz teams to victory, rock bands to ruckus applause, and church teams to faithful service. In the office, I am happy to dig into the details or wrangle with the next high-level, strategic decision. The most important thing to me is that we all win as a team. I believe this approach to leadership is why a former CEO told me that people are willing to work better and harder for me. I inspire people to bring their best and elevate their performance out of the joy of team success.

Renaissance Man.
I have had a lot of brutal jobs - ditches in the desert, cell towers hundreds of feet high, support calls, mind-numbing hours as a CPA, and, hardest of all, little league baseball umpire. I have been told several times by my CEO that I am a Renaissance Man. My vast experiences in the Finance world (tax, audit, financial operations, systems, FP&A, etc.) enable me to bring great insights, and my broad work experiences, SaaS and otherwise, help me bring perspective and build rapport.

If I sound like the kind of Finance pro that you want to know better, please send me a message.

Hicks,"Provo, Utah, United States","20 Years Experience as a Commercial/Revenue Leader, driving organizations of various size to double-digit revenue and margin growth via direct sales, channel partner integration/collaboration, route-to-market strategy development & execution, team building & people development, eight-figure contract negotiations, digital technology adoption, and obsession with customer/UX feedback. I have a track record of building strong interpersonal relationships across cultures and functions, and of helping teams learn and analyze complex principles & data quickly, translating them into actionable business processes that create commercial value. 

I'm a family man, happily married to Jenn and a father of six. Professionally, I relish the challenge of finding synergies between partners and customers to meet the rapidly-evolving needs of consumers (B2C) and businesses (B2B) in the IoT era.

Over the last 20 years, I’ve met face-to-face with more than 90,000 people, engaging with them as a director, manager, or as an individually-contributing sales or marketing professional. I have learned about customers’ ambitions/goals, and then partnered with them to map out the steps needed to achieve their targets. Digitally, I have engaged in live and on-demand video presentations to interact with another 50,000 people. 

In leading large and small teams, I have successfully implemented new business models and high-quality sales pipeline management in both cutting edge and traditionally commoditized industries (digital pathology, computer software, oil & gas, higher education, real estate, sports coaching, door-to-door sales). I have achieved these sweeping changes through the use of proprietary technologies (AI/Machine Learning/cloud-based/SaaS/petrochemical formulations) and laser-focused attention on the short- and long-term needs of our customers & prospects throughout the sales cycle, never losing focus on how to keep them relevant, profitable, and sustainable.

Tell us your challenges (or your customers’ challenges) as you navigate today’s on-demand/real-time stakeholder expectations, and my team and I will help you find the resources to ""nail the pain"" you're facing on your journey to meet customers and partners “where they are now” and “where they hope to be tomorrow”.",Techcyte,urn:li:fs_salesCompany:7961728,Vice President of Sales,https://linkedin.com/company/7961728,"urn:li:fs_salesProfile:(ACwAAAfwa9wBKC2VzAXbeFga5mVwa2iM4gNS8Cs,NAME_SEARCH,KheD)",ACwAAAfwa9wBKC2VzAXbeFga5mVwa2iM4gNS8Cs,https://linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAfwa9wBKC2VzAXbeFga5mVwa2iM4gNS8Cs,urn:li:member:133196764,techcyte.com,"105 S.

208,1049,Potter,Jon,Jon Potter,"Lehi, Utah, United States","I am a Finance executive bringing years of in-the-trenches SaaS experience. I build rapport across the company, tell the story from the numbers, and offer inspiring leadership that empowers growth.

Finance Exec.
From fundraising to KPIs, I tell the story for the numbers. I remember my knees rattling as I presented for the first time to a board of directors, worried they would want every detail of our financial statements. I have since learned that the most important aspect in presenting financial reports and metrics is the story. CEOs, investors, and the management team want to know where we’ve been and where we will go. I break the numbers down, so that we can make decisions that dominate markets, raise capital, create great products, and make happy employees.

Inspiring Leader.
I have lead Junior Jazz teams to victory, rock bands to ruckus applause, and church teams to faithful service. In the office, I am happy to dig into the details or wrangle with the next high-level, strategic decision. The most important thing to me is that we all win as a team. I believe this approach to leadership is why a former CEO told me that people are willing to work better and harder for me. I inspire people to bring their best and elevate their performance out of the joy of team success.

Renaissance Man.
I have had a lot of brutal jobs - ditches in the desert, cell towers hundreds of feet high, support calls, mind-numbing hours as a CPA, and, hardest of all, little league baseball umpire. I have been told several times by my CEO that I am a Renaissance Man. My vast experiences in the Finance world (tax, audit, financial operations, systems, FP&A, etc.) enable me to bring great insights, and my broad work experiences, SaaS and otherwise, help me bring perspective and build rapport.

If I sound like the kind of Finance pro that you want to know better, please send me a message.
